Roll to Victory is a thrilling dice game designed for two players, where the objective is to accumulate 100 points before your opponent does. The game revolves around luck and strategic decision-making, as players take turns rolling a dice to earn points.

Gameplay:
At the start of the game, both players begin with a score of zero. The players alternate turns, and on each turn, the active player rolls a standard six-sided dice.

After rolling the dice, the active player earns points based on the number shown on the dice. The point values are as follows:

If the dice shows a 1, the active player earns no points, and their turn ends immediately.
If the dice shows a number between 2 and 6 (inclusive), the active player earns that number of points, and they can choose to either roll again or end their turn.
The accumulated points from each successful roll are added to the active player's total score. The player can continue rolling as long as they avoid rolling a 1 or decide to stop and end their turn voluntarily. However, if a 1 is rolled, the active player loses all points accumulated during that turn, and their turn ends immediately. It is then the opponent's turn to play.

The game progresses with each player taking turns, aiming to accumulate points towards the target score of 100. The first player to reach or exceed 100 points wins the game, and their opponent is declared the runner-up.
